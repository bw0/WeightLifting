## Summary

- The project task is to provide a classifier that, when given the specified body-worn motion sensor data, determines if the motion is a specific correctly performed weight lifting exercise, or one of four specified incorrect executions of that exercise.

- A classifier was created using Random Forest and correctly predicted the 20 externally-graded test cases.

- A variety of techniques were applied and validations were performed in the development and testing of the final model.
